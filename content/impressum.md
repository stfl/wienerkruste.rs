## Liability for Content

As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in
accordance with general legislation. However, we are not obligated to monitor
transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances
that indicate illegal activity.

Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general law remain
unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of
knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon becoming aware of such violations, we
will remove this content immediately.

## Liability for Links

Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content
we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this
external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always
responsible for the content of the linked pages.

The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However,
permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable
without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon becoming aware of legal
violations, we will remove such links immediately.
